# Lab4_Interrupts

Last time in the laboratory we deepened our knowledge about timers and the possibility to passively evaluate them. 
Therefore, we configured Timer0, Timer1, and CCP1 to set flags after time x. Using only a timer has the disadvantage
that we cannot easily achieve precise timings. Thus, we used the Capture Compare Module. Using the CCP increased the
accuracy of the timing, but due to the cyclic execution of the main code we stil had some very minor delays in our
evaluation.
Today, we will deepen our understanding of interrupts and how to use them to overcome those known limitations.

## Relevant registers
For today's laboratory we will need the previously used registers to configure our Oscialltor, I/O pins, Timers, CCP Module, and the
registers introduced in the lecture. All those registers are listed below. Please check them to ensure you are aware
of all relevant registers for today.
